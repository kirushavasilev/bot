# My first code-based project converted into a real-world product.
When I was 11, I created and hosted a telegram chatbot to deliver daily weather forecasts to my family members, hardly knowing anything about coding.
This is just one of the iterations of the chatbot that I made at the time.

Although it seems very basic nowadays, I was extremely proud to develop the skills of reading technical documentation of a yet-developing functionality of chatbots in Telegram.
It was then when I was first exposed to VPS hosting too, discovering ways to run and edit the code on a remote Ubuntu server.
It feels great to grow both physically and knowledge-wise, since memories like this inspire nostalgia and the need grow even further.
